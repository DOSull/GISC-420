## COVID provisions
### General
This is a small class and much of it can be completed remotely so we are pretty well-placed to handle the uncertainties of the COVID situation, provided we stay in close contact with one another.

For the first half of the semester we have agreed to run the class online over zoom. You can find the meeting session information on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_3363860_1&course_id=_117008_1&mode=reset "login required").

Depending on how things pan out, there should be face to face lab sessions in Cotton 110 in the second half of the semester, but if we have to we can revert easily to remote, and details will be provided as needed. We can record and stream from Cotton 110, although it's not very satisfactory, so if you can attend and class is running face to face, then it's best that we do that.

### Masks
For face-to-face instruction you are required to wear a mask per the university guidance on the red traffic light setting: "Students need to wear a mask at all times while indoors in public spaces on campus, including learning and teaching spaces (with the exception of the Library if they are able to maintain a 2m distance from others. Even in this latter situation, students will still be encouraged to keep their masks on)."

## Recording your movements
You must record entry using the COVID app and/or sign in sheet. Sanitise hands on entry and exit from labs. Wipe down your workstation (keyboard, mouse) with wipes provided at start and end of session.
