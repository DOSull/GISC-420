#### GISC 420 T1 2021
# Introduction to Python basics
This week we have four instruction sets to explore. One of them is this one, so three more to go.

+ [Arithmetic, values and types](00-arithmetic-values-and-types.md)
+ [Variables, expressions and statements](01-variables-expressions-and-statements.md)
+ [Turtles all the way down](02-turtles.md)

You should work through these in order, to begin to get a feel for Python code, what it looks like, and some basic aspects of its behaviour. You should do this in the IDLE program, starting it from the course Python environment, per the [instructions here](../README.md#week-1)

It is a good idea in general to work through material in the _Diving Into Python_ book in this way. It's a much better way to learn than just reading.
