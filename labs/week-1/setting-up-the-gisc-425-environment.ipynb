The lab computers have these installed and ready to go and you are free to work on those machines when doing work for this class.

    "[Python](https://python.org) is a widely used, general-purpose programming language. It is regarded as easy to learn, yet it is very powerful. It is good at most things we need a programming language to be good at, the only major exceptions being client-side interactions on websites and really high-performance applications. For our purposes it is ideal, particularly the 'easy to learn' part."

I have chosen it as the preferred platform within which we will learn Python programming in this class, at least to begin with.\n",

The nuts and bolts, or building blocks that we will be working with are a collection of *modules* (that's their proper name but they often get called *libraries* or *packages*). These provide the kinds of functionality (e.g. reading and writing shapefiles, projecting geographic coordinates) that we need to build geospatial applications and do geographic analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the packages we'll be working with are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [`GDAL`](https://pypi.org/project/GDAL/) is the Geographic Data Abstraction Library which handles a lot of low-level geospatial data management and manipulation, which lots of other packages need to work properly\n",
    "+ [`fiona`](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona) handles reading and writing data formats and [`shapely`](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) deals with basic geometry operations such as buffering and so on\n",
    "+ [`geopandas`](http://geopandas.org/) is a simple library for dealing with classic geometry-attributes spatial data (shapefiles are an example) in a convenient way\n",
    "+ [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) provides plotting functionality and is used by `geopandas` to make simple maps\n",
    "+ [`mplleaflet`](https://github.com/jwass/mplleaflet) makes simple (leaflet) web maps from `matplotlib` maps\n",
    "+ numerical Python [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) and scientifif Python [`scipy`](https://www.scipy.org/) are general purpose scientific computing libraries that provide analytical tools beyond the basic functions in the Python base `math` module\n",
    "+ [`pysal`](http://pysal.org/) provides a lot of functionality useful for spatial analysis\n",
    "+ [`networkx`](https://networkx.github.io/) lets us store, manipulate and analyse network data\n",
    "+ [`arcpy`](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.5/analyze/arcpy/what-is-arcpy-.htm) and [`PyQGIS`](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html) are respectively the Python *Application Programming Interfaces* (APIs) for ESRI's *ArcGIS* and the *QGIS* desktop GIS programs.
