# Introduction to notebooks and Python basics
This week we have ~five~ ~four~ three instruction sets to explore. One of them is this one.

The two important ones are

+ [Arithmetic, values and types](arithmetic-values-and-types.md)
+ [Variables, expressions and statements](variables-expressions-and-statements.md)

You should work through these in order, to get familiar with the environment, and begin to get a feel for Python code, what it looks like, and some basic aspects of its behaviour.


#### Deprecated (no longer relevant)
~The fifth notebook provides information on how to setup an environment (hopefully) identical to the lab machine environment, on your own computer:~

~+ [Setting up the GISC 425 environment](setting-up-the-gisc-425-environment.md)~

### That's all from this notebook!
