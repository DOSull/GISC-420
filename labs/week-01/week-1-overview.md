# Introduction to Python basics
This week we have four instruction sets to explore. One of them is this one, so three more to go.

+ [Arithmetic, values and types](arithmetic-values-and-types.md)
+ [Variables, expressions and statements](variables-expressions-and-statements.md)
+ [Turtles all the way down](turtles.md)

You should work through these in order, to begin to get a feel for Python code, what it looks like, and some basic aspects of its behaviour. It is a good idea in general to work through material in the _Diving Into Python_ book in this way. It's a much better way to learn than just reading.
