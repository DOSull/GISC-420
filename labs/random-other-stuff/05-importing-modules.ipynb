This is something you should avoid doing, but it is important to know what is happening when you import a module or classes and functions from a module in various different ways.\n",

The one way in which performance might be affected is if you are repeatedly accessing a class or function in a loop. For example, this code using the 'fully-aliased' `Point` class reference"
