    "A final useful, albeit non-spatial capability is to merge the data tables based on shared values of a particular attribute.  This is accomplished with the `pandas` `merge` function, and an example is provided [here](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/mergingdata.html). More complete documentation is available [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html).\n",
