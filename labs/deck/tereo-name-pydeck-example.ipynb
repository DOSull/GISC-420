    "# A simple example getting Python to drive JavaScript\n",
    "A lot of the nicest new frameworks (for mapping or anything else) happen first these days, or develop most quickly in the web-space. This has a great deal to do with the enormous resources poured into the web as a platform, which have seen previously unimaginable development of the JavaScript (JS) prgramming language and of the associated virtual machines (which are everywhere now... every phone, every computer, and so on...).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result anyone writing code today should at least be web-aware. And that means being somewhat acquainted with the JS world.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at an example of web-programming (non-map related) in class, but to also give you a sense of why this is an exciting space below we use [`pydeck`](https://pydeck.gl/index.html) to drive the [`deck.gl`](https://deck.gl/) framework for interactive 3D visualisation."

Note that the example may not work in VSCode---I think due to security settings of the HTML viewer (it's not insecure... all the data are local, it's some setting associated with 'cross-origin' resources)."
