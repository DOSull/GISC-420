# General instructions for the Labs
## Week 1
In week 1, we will use IDLE a simple code editor to get a feel for typing Python code at an interactive prompt. To complete the materials in week 1 open IDLE on your computer (we'll show you where to find it), and then work on the materials [here](week-1/week-1-overview.md).

## Weeks 2 to 6 and 11
In most weeks for the first half of the semester we will use Jupyter notebooks, hosted on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing. You need to login (with your VUW credentials) to [notebooks.azure.com](https://notebooks.azure.com). Then, each week clone the corresponding project in my Azure account at

## Longer project programming exercise, second half of trimester
After the break starting week 7 you will work in pairs on a longer, more challenging programming exercise. Some ideas for this are posted on [this page](week-7/longer-project-ideas-and-scope.md), which I will add to as they come to me. We can also discuss (at any time) ideas you might have for interesting problems to tackle.

I will start bugging you all about this from around week 3 onwards...
