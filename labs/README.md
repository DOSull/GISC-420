#### GISC 425 T1 2020
# General instructions for the Labs
We will be using some different things as the course progresses. Follow the relevant instructions below.

## Week 1
+ Open the **Anaconda Prompt**.
+ Navigate to a folder where you plan to save work. First you may need to change disk, by typing `D:` or `H:` or whatever. Then you need to type `cd <path-to-folder>`.
+ Then, at the prompt, enable the GISC 425 environment with

      conda activate g425

  The prompt should change to the prefix `(g425)`.
+ Then run IDLE by typing

      idle

+ In IDLE start typing python commands per the instructions.

## Weeks 2 to 6
Each week, you should download the associated `week-n.zip` file, **linked from the timetable on the course main page** and extract it to a folder on your computer. In Windows be particularly careful to right-click and extract the files to an actual folder as many version of Windows let you look inside zip archives without actually extracting the files.

Once you have extracted the files, then follow the instructions below as required.

### On *Windows*
+ Open the **Anaconda Prompt**.
+ Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. First you may need to change disk, by typing `D:` or `H:` or whatever. Then you need to type `cd <path-to-your-files>` where *path-to-your-files* is the directory you extracted the files.
+ Then, at the prompt, enable the GISC 425 environment with

      conda activate g425

  The prompt should change to the prefix `(g425)`.
+ Then run Jupyter notebook by typing

      jupyter notebook

  From there, things should be reasonably straightforward.

### On *MacOS* or *Linux*
Here it is assumed you have followed instructions on [this page](week-1/setting-up-the-gisc-425-environment.ipynb) to set up for the course.

+ Open a console.
+ Navigate to where you extracted the lab files.
+ Start the GISC 425 environment within

      conda activate g425

+ Run Jupyter notebook by typing

      jupyter notebook

## Even more subsequent weeks
We will look at working in an Integrated Development Environment after the semester break.
